## Company Checker (HackNC 2020)
Company Checker is a chrome plug-in that uses the chrome.tabs API to allow users to check the company's ethical/sustainable goals quickly when online shopping. 

## About
In light of important social issues today, we believe that consumers should be empowered with knowledge to make socially conscious decisions.

## Demo
Include demo link etc.

## Obstacles
We ran into issues with finding a data set to work with that described or ranked the sustainability or ethics of the production process of companies. Our other issues included learning how to work with Chrome extensions and navigating scripts and files to produce an informative experience. 

## Future Steps
Future steps include web scraping data or building a database and relying on user contributions.
